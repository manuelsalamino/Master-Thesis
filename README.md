# Master Thesis - Anomaly Detection via Isolation Forest Embedding

Look at the [Executive Summary](https://github.com/manuelsalamino/Master-Thesis/blob/main/Executive_Summary.pdf) (a 6 pages paper-like summary) to have a brief overview of the thesis.

## Abstract
Anomaly Detection (AD) is a Data Mining process and consists finding unusual patterns or rare observations in a set of data. Usually anomalies represent negative events, in fact anomaly detection is used in many different fields, from medicine to industry. We faced the problem by taking as starting point a milestone AD algorithm: Isolation Forest (iForest). This thesis propose to use the **intermediate output of iForest** to create an **embedding**, hence a new data representation on which known classification or anomaly detection techniques can be applied. Our empirical evaluation shows that our approach performs just as well, and sometimes better, than iForest on the same data. But our most important result is the creation of a new framework to enable other techniques to improve the anomaly detection performance.
